# RE Walkthrough Pro

> Turn a Zillow listing into a cinematic, room-by-room walkthrough video — right inside [Claude Code](https://claude.ai/code). Apify pulls the photos, Higgsfield animates each room, ffmpeg stitches the final cut. Built to sell to real estate agents.

RE Walkthrough Pro ships the **`re-walkthrough-pro`** skill: a single command that takes a Zillow listing (or finds you some), pulls every photo, animates each room into a short cinematic camera-move clip, and stitches them into one finished walkthrough video you can hand an agent.

A finished tour that looks like a $1,000–3,000 production, made from listing photos in minutes, for sub-cents of scraping plus a handful of Higgsfield credits.

> **Honest framing:** This produces a *cinematic walkthrough* (per-room camera-move clips stitched together), **not** a true 3D / Matterport reconstruction. It looks premium, and it's impossible without an AI video engine — but don't promise a walkable dollhouse.

---

## Why

Agents pay for media. The bottleneck is production time. RE Walkthrough Pro removes it: one command, listing in → sellable walkthrough out. Drop it into a real estate marketing service as a video line item, or batch tours across a whole farm area and pitch the listing agents.

The architecture is the unlock. Higgsfield video models work clip-by-clip (~5s image-to-video), so a whole-house walkthrough **must** be per-room clips stitched on your side. This skill does exactly that, with a camera move matched to each room type so the stitched result reads like walking through the home.

## Install

### Option 1 — `npx` (recommended)

```bash
npx re-walkthrough-pro install
```

Installs the skill to `~/.claude/skills/re-walkthrough-pro/`. Refresh after a package upgrade:

```bash
npm view re-walkthrough-pro version       # check latest
npx re-walkthrough-pro@latest update      # refresh in place
```

### Option 2 — Global install

```bash
npm install -g re-walkthrough-pro
re-walkthrough-pro install
```

### Option 3 — Directly from GitHub

```bash
npx github:charlesdove977/re-walkthrough-pro install
```

### Project-scoped install (per repo)

```bash
cd ~/path/to/project
npx re-walkthrough-pro install --project
```

### Uninstall / where

```bash
npx re-walkthrough-pro uninstall
npx re-walkthrough-pro where            # ~/.claude/skills/re-walkthrough-pro
```

Restart Claude Code after installing, then run `/re-walkthrough-pro`.

## What you need

Two MCP servers connected in Claude Code, plus ffmpeg:

- **[Higgsfield MCP](https://higgsfield.ai/s/higgsfield-mcp-v3-earning-series-charlieautomates-ptQTLe)** — required. Animates each room (Seedance 2.0 / Kling 3.0 image-to-video) and reframes for social. Every image + video model in one credit pool. *(My affiliate link.)*
- **[Apify account](https://www.apify.com?fpr=charles)** — required for the listing scrape. The Zillow detail scraper pulls photos + address + specs in one call. *(My referral link.)* Grab the [Apify MCP server](https://github.com/apify/actors-mcp-server) (`@apify/actors-mcp-server`) and your token at [console.apify.com](https://console.apify.com/settings/integrations).
- **ffmpeg** — required for stitching (`brew install ffmpeg`).

---

## How it works

```
1. RESOLVE   Zillow link → Apify detail scraper (photos + address + specs)
             "find 5 in NJ" → search actor → detail scraper (chained dataset)
2. PERSIST   write PROPERTY.md, download all photos to source-images/
3. CURATE    vision pass: best photo per room, drop floorplans/dupes, tag room type
4. ANIMATE   per room → Higgsfield image-to-video with a room-matched camera move
5. STITCH    ffmpeg concat in walkthrough order → 16:9 master (+ optional 9:16)
6. DELIVER   final video + per-room scenes + PROPERTY.md, in one folder
```

### Two ways in

- **Single property:** paste a Zillow listing URL (or an address).
- **Discovery:** "find 5 single-family homes in Montclair NJ" → it searches, shows you the listings, you pick.

### Room → camera move

Each room type gets a cinematic move (drone approach for the exterior, steadicam walkthrough for halls, orbit for great rooms, window-approach reveals for views, rising reveal for the backyard). The moves are model-agnostic — they apply to whatever Higgsfield video model you pick.

├── source-images/       every photo pulled from Zillow

## What gets installed

```
~/.claude/skills/re-walkthrough-pro/
├── SKILL.md
├── tasks/

├── frameworks/

```

Walkthroughs are written to your *project* (`listing-walkthroughs/`), never into the skill folder.

---

## Optional: richer prompt craft

The built-in camera-move mapping is self-sufficient. If you also have the **`seedance-real-estate`** and **`seedance-cinematic`** skills installed (both ship inside [UGC Factory](https://www.npmjs.com/package/ugc-factory)), the skill invokes them for richer per-room motion prompts and a film-look color grade. Purely additive — nothing breaks without them.

## FAQ

**Is this true 3D?**
No. It's per-room cinematic camera-move clips stitched into a tour. Premium-looking, honest to describe as a "cinematic walkthrough," not a Matterport dollhouse.

**Does it touch my repo when I install?**
No. Default install writes to `~/.claude/skills/re-walkthrough-pro/`. Only `--project` writes into the current directory.

**Does Zillow block scraping?**
Zillow blocks naive `fetch`/headless, which is exactly why the skill routes images through the Apify actor — the reliable source for both the link and discovery paths.

**What does a run cost?**
The Apify scrape is sub-cent per property. The real cost is Higgsfield credits, scaled by room count — which is why the skill auto-curates to ~6–10 hero rooms by default.
